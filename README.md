Summary:\
Our aims with this research are to determine which environmental variables are most important for predicting the distribution of *Ecklonia Radiata* across the Great Southern Reef, and to predict the future distribution of *Ecklonia radiata* for the periods 2040-2050 and 2090-2100, under three climate scenarios (SSP1, SSP2 and SSP3). Using environmental data from Bio-ORACLE, we will evaluate which variables are the most influential, and use these to create predictions from three models: a Generalised Linear Model, Maxent and Random Forest. We will then evaluate and compare their predicted outputs for suitable habitat and species distributions, to determine the potential impacts of climate change on *Ecklonia Radiata*.

Scientific Hypotheses:\
We hypothesise that range contraction for *Ecklonia Radiata* will occur under all SSP scenarios in 2040-2050, but will be greatest under SSP3 and smallest under SSP1. For SSP2 and SSP3, we expect that greater range contraction will occur at 2090-2100 compared to 2040-2050. Under SSP1, however, the range of suitable habitat is predicted to expand back towards present-day levels in 2090-2100 - following the improvement in environmental conditions at this time point. All environmental variables discussed are expected to contribute to the models\
